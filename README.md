# Face Recognition Frontend

This is the frontend for a face recognition application. It sends an image to the [backend](https://github.com/richardeboehm/face_recognition_backend) via a REST API, and the backend uses the [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) API to respond with the coordinates of any faces in the image.

The application was deployed using Heroku -- you can play around with it [here](https://face-recognition-frontend-rb.herokuapp.com/).
