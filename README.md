# Face Recognition Frontend

This is the frontend for a face recognition application. It sends an image to the backend via a REST API, and the backend responds with the coordinates of any faces in the image.

The application was deployed using Heroku -- you can play around with it [here](https://face-recognition-frontend-rb.herokuapp.com/).
